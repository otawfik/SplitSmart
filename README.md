## ✨ How It Works

1.  **📸 Scan**: Upload a photo of your receipt. Our AI Vision engine parses every item, price, tax, and tip instantly.
2.  **💬 Chat**: Tell the app who had what. "Alice had the burger," "Bob and I shared the nachos," or "The wine is for everyone."
3.  **⚖️ Split**: Watch totals update in real-time. Tax and tip are automatically distributed proportionally based on what each person spent.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Intelligence**: Gemini 3 Pro (Vision & NLP) for seamless receipt parsing and intent recognition.
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript for a fast, modern, and type-safe user experience.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a premium, responsive "split-screen" interface.
- **Fonts**: Inter & JetBrains Mono for a clean, technical aesthetic.
