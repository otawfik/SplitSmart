## ✨ How It Works

1.  **📸 Scan**: Upload a photo of your receipt. Our AI Vision parses every item, price, tax, and tip.
2.  **💬 Chat**: Tell the app who had what. "Alice had the burger," "Bob and I shared the nachos," or "The wine is for everyone."
3.  **⚖️ Split**: Watch as the totals update in real-time. Tax and tip are automatically distributed proportionally.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Vision AI**: Gemini 3 Pro for high-accuracy OCR and intent parsing.
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript for a robust, type-safe experience.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive "split-screen" UI.
- **Typography**: Inter & JetBrains Mono for that premium utility feel.

## 📖 Deployment Guide (Get your link!)

To make this app accessible via a link on your GitHub profile, follow these steps:

1.  **Vercel (Recommended)**: 
    - Connect your GitHub repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
    - Add your `API_KEY` in the Environment Variables section.
    - It will give you a public URL (e.g., `splitsmart-ai.vercel.app`).
2.  **Update this README**: Replace `YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL_HERE` with your new link.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Shared Items**: The AI understands complex splits. Try: "Split the appetizers between everyone except Dave."
- **Corrections**: Made a mistake? Just say "Remove the beer from Sarah" and the totals recalculate instantly.
- **Accessibility**: Works seamlessly on mobile—perfect for use right at the dinner table.
